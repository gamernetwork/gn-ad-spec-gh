****GamesIndustry.biz only**

All ads can be created in house via the Gamer Creative offering.

## Custom Ads

Gamer Network offers rich media ads which differ from standard IAB sizes.

## Takeovers

Site Takeovers are a high impact desktop format that pairs the top leaderboard & halfpage units together with a  re-skin of the site background. Due to site layout the format for this creative varies by domain, so it is incredibly important that the right template is used for your campaign. If you are unsure about what template is required please contact your sales representative or ad ops team member for clarification. 

Takeover ads can contain autoplaying video if compliant with our video specs (link to PDF).  Video should be part of the subload and the total file size cannot exceed 1.5MB.  Only one creative in the takeover can have auto-playing video to avoid negatively affecting a user’s CPU and experience on the site.  Any video should only autoplay if more that 50% is in view.
