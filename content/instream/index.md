There are several options for running video advertising across our network of sites and Youtube channels:

- **Instream Prerolls:** Videos appearing before user-initiated video content on our sites in our own player. They are skippable after 5 seconds.

- **Outstream:** Autoplaying video ads that appear within content on both desktop and mobile. They can be closed by the user.

- **Youtube:** Ads appearing on our Youtube channels before, during or after the main content.

With supply please ensure that the video is with us no less than 48 hours in advance of the campaign start date due to Googleâ€™s YT QA process.

The preferred format for supply is MP4 and VAST tags are subject to the extended QA process.

As of Q1 2018 Google suspended the use of all third-party ad technology apart from the following certified vendors:

- comScore
- DoubleVerify
- IAS
- MOAT
- Nielsen
- Kantar
- Research Now
- DoubleClick Campaign Manager

Please ensure when using these vendors that implementation is limited to a simple measurement pixel and tracked click through URL - no data functions will be accepted and will be refused within the QA process.

Any campaign that fails the QA process will require re-submitting and resets the initial time taken to submit for review.
