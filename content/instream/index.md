All our video inventory is housed on YouTube and is limited to the following two options for pre-roll:

<div class="table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>Skippable video ads</td>
      <td>Skippable video ads allow views to skip ads after 5 seconds if they wish. Inserted before, during or after the main video.</td> 
      <td>Desktop, mobile devices, TV and game consoles</td>
      <td>Plays in video player.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Non-skippable video ads</td>
      <td>Non-skippable video ads must be watched before your video can be viewed. These ads can appear before, during or after the main video.</td> 
      <td>Desktop and mobile devices</td>
      <td>Plays in video player. 15 or 20 seconds in length, depending on regional standards</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

With supply please ensure that the video is with us no longer than 48 hours in advance of the campaign start date due to Googleâ€™s YT Q&A process.

The preferred format for supply is MP4 and VAST tags are subject to the extended Q&A process.

As of Q1 2018 Google suspended the use of all third-party ad technology apart from the following certified vendors:

- comScore
- DoubleVerify
- IAS
- MOAT
- Nielsen
- Kantar
- Research Now
- DoubleClick Campaign Manager

Please ensure when using these vendors that implementation is limited to a simple measurement pixel and tracked click through URL - no data functions will be accepted and will be refused within the Q&A process.

Any campaign that fails the Q&A process will require re-submitting and resets the initial time taken to submit for review.
