Site Takeovers are a high impact desktop format that pairs the top leaderboard & halfpage units together with a re-skin of the site background. Due to site layout the format for this creative varies by domain, so it is incredibly important that the right template is used for your campaign. If you are unsure about what template is required please contact your sales representative or ad ops team member for clarification.

Takeover ads can contain autoplaying video and the **total file size of the video cannot exceed 900KB.** Only one creative in the takeover can have auto-playing video to avoid negatively affecting a userâ€™s CPU and experience on the site. **Any video should only autoplay if more that 50% is in view.**

Custom templates are used in order to change the site background as part of the takeover. If you are supplying HTML banners as part of the takeover please note only one banner can be an HTML zip file, either the leaderboard or the halfpage. Both units can run third-party tags at the same time if required.

Please use the PSD templates provided. They will indicate which areas are the 'safe' zones for key messaging and logos and demonstrates how the units works together on our page templates.

Refer to our [HTML5 Guidelines](#html5) if supplying HTML5 creatives.
