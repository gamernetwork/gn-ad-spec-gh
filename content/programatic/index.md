Programmatic activation is primarily handled through Googleâ€™s DoubleClick product to delivery the following buying methods:

- Private Auction
- Preferred Deal
- Programmatic Guaranteed

We are able to handle custom creative for the Programmatic Guaranteed based deals however all other Q&A is the responsibility of the uploader or trading desk.

The above can cater for everything from first party data, AMP only packages or even high viewability placements to ensure the highest brand safety. If your campaign has any requirements please ensure we are fully aware well in advance to the start date so the order for review can be approved in a ready to run state.

In addition to the above we can also handle PMP based buys through Exchange Bidding tech for the following providers:

- Index Exchange
- OpenX
- TripleLift
- Rubicon

Please ensure the programmatic account manager is fully aware of the buy method before campaign activation.

Programmatic video follows the same spec as In-Stream Video (above).
