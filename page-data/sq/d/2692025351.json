{"data":{"file":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Desktop Takeovers are a high impact desktop format that pairs the top leaderboard &#x26; halfpage units together with a re-skin of the site background. The background skin image is ‘sticky’ so follows the user down the page as they read content.</p>\n<p>Due to site layout the format for this creative varies by domain, so it is incredibly important that the right template is used for your campaign. If you are unsure about what template is required please contact your sales representative or ad ops team member for clarification.</p>\n<p>If you are supplying your own designs then we have several options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Static takeovers (made up of jpg images)</li>\n<li>Video takeovers (these can include a small autoplaying video)</li>\n<li>HTML or Third-Party tags (the leaderboard or halfpage can be a third-party tag or HTML zip, but not the background skin image)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For static and video takeovers please use the PSD templates provided. They will indicate which areas are the ‘safe’ zones for key messaging and logos. Please also stick to the file sizes below.</p>\n<p>Refer to our <a href=\"#html5\">HTML5 Guidelines</a> if supplying HTML5 creatives. They will need to be zip files and support a clickTag for uploading to Google Ad Manager.</p>\n<div class=\"important-note\">\n  <p>\n    <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE ON FILE SIZES</strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>Below we specify file sizes in order to ensure your creatives load fast when delivered on our sites. Google Ad Manager supports files up to 1MB in size but please try to make images and video as small as possible.</p>\n  <p>Smaller creative sizes also mean less bandwidth, less computer power, less battery drain and are better for the environment - a 1MB video doing 2M impressions in the UK would release over 1 Tonne of Carbon (source: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://good-loop.com/resources/carbon-calculator\">https://good-loop.com/resources/carbon-calculator</a>).</p>\n  <p>So keeping files small helps make a difference, and faster ads are a win-win for everyone.</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"","imageright":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"sizes":"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px","srcSet":"/gn-ad-spec/static/d1282cd4fdaa6147a9ce8854e24e2cd1/c01e2/GFuel_Skin_Showcase.jpg 320w,\n/gn-ad-spec/static/d1282cd4fdaa6147a9ce8854e24e2cd1/f422e/GFuel_Skin_Showcase.jpg 640w,\n/gn-ad-spec/static/d1282cd4fdaa6147a9ce8854e24e2cd1/ec6c5/GFuel_Skin_Showcase.jpg 1280w,\n/gn-ad-spec/static/d1282cd4fdaa6147a9ce8854e24e2cd1/d8255/GFuel_Skin_Showcase.jpg 1920w","aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwABBP/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAe42xFo4r//EABsQAAIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxAREiEx/9oACAEBAAEFAnuZH1GOYBiYkp//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEf/aAAgBAwEBPwGH/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBH/2gAIAQIBAT8Bp//EABsQAAEEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAhAREjGh/9oACAEBAAY/Ami6WQJiytdj/8QAGxABAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBUXH/2gAIAQEAAT8hYdBM1FyEYuLB7CIgNmm4opSepoon/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABDYz//EABcRAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQESH/2gAIAQMBAT8QW3sf/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREQ/9oACAECAQE/EAEpn//EABwQAQEBAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQXGBof/aAAgBAQABPxB/5/Zcs7o0Xpnhx3KqFW8wyVnEDIfHBxjoUD9wSpAhW7//2Q==","src":"/gn-ad-spec/static/d1282cd4fdaa6147a9ce8854e24e2cd1/ec6c5/GFuel_Skin_Showcase.jpg","srcSetWebp":"/gn-ad-spec/static/d1282cd4fdaa6147a9ce8854e24e2cd1/8dbf3/GFuel_Skin_Showcase.webp 320w,\n/gn-ad-spec/static/d1282cd4fdaa6147a9ce8854e24e2cd1/991d2/GFuel_Skin_Showcase.webp 640w,\n/gn-ad-spec/static/d1282cd4fdaa6147a9ce8854e24e2cd1/135cd/GFuel_Skin_Showcase.webp 1280w,\n/gn-ad-spec/static/d1282cd4fdaa6147a9ce8854e24e2cd1/25f09/GFuel_Skin_Showcase.webp 1920w"}}}}}}}}
